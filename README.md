# Quartz

Quartz is parallel project of [Amethyst](https://github.com/railken/amethyst) written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). 

The scope of this project is to build a panel that is fully customizable and update itself based on the data provided by the API

The idea behind this project was to create a parallel frontend package for each [Amethyst Package](https://github.com/topics/amethyst-package). 
I'm saying was because mantaining nearly 100 packages is devastating, 
that's why now all data are generated using [amethyst/data-view](https://github.com/railken/amethyst-data-view) and [quartz/data-view](https://github.com/railken/quartz-data-view)

The API provides all the informations needed such as data schema and views to build the panel.
